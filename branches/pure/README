This branch is for pure python only. This is where investigation of
tricky tricks using Numpy may go.

The trunk also has pure python implementations of most algorithms, but the
design there is dominated by modularity. In this branch I am happy to break
compatibility to get good efficiency without resorting to cython, fortran 
or C.
