This is for a branch of the code which will be strictly 2D.

Dimension agnostic code is hard to write and hard to read.

2D particle systems are fun and useful.

hence this solution.

Will need to plan the directory structure and how it works in svn when I am less tired.


For simplicity all Cython extensions have been removed. To do: convert everything back to 2d, then add this as a branch to pyticles. Alternatively, add this as a branch to pyticles, and then convert everything to 2D.
