Fast feedback improves the pace of scientific software development.
The pyticles interface is designed to provide a game-like level of control
over the visualisation and control of the particle systems. Some support is provided
for two dimensional visualisation, however the focus is on three dimensional SPH fluids.

View control is managed through a trackball camera class made available by Roger Allen.
