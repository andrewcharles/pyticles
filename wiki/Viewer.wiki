Fast feedback improves the past of scientific software development.
The interface is designed to provide a game-like level of control
over the visualisation and control of the particle systems.
As the priority feature for the python code is 3 dimensions, it seems appropriate that the 3 dimensional view be also a priority. This will simply use Pyglet's interface to OpenGL.

I have now incorporated a simple wireframe particle display.

This is going ok, thanks to a 3d trackball camera module I have obtained, and some OpenGL revision.
