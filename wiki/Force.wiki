#summary Describes the Force object and how it works

A Force alters the rates of change of a ParticleSystem. It is the mapping from the particle attributes to the x and xdot state vectors that tells you which variables are fair game for being modified by a Force, and which aren't.

A Force is the right hand side of the differential equation xdot = f(x).

If a force depends on a rate of change then we have a potential ordering problem where the application of one force before another alters the outcome of the other force calculation. This is inconsistent, as we assume all the forces act simultaneously.

Most applications will only require the update of dv/dt and de/dt,
