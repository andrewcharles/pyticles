Pyticles is a set of python modules for a low performance physically based
particle system in python.

In the future I would like to integrate some elements with lepton.

The main driver is my smooth particle research. There are a number of
front end scripts for pyticles:

1. pyspam
This is the front end for testing algorithms related to my research.


2. pyticles
This is where the bulk of the work on the interactive gui is going.



4. particle_man

This is to be an effort to produce a simple game using the pyticles
modules.







This is an effort to produce a smooth particle code in python.

Why?

1. More scripted approach to execution
2. Visualisation in real time
3. Fast prototyping of new algoritms
4. Integration with the fortran code
