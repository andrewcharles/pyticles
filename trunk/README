This is an effort to produce a smooth particle code in python.

Why?

1. More scripted approach to execution
2. Visualisation in real time
3. Fast prototyping of new algoritms
4. Integration with the fortran code

The octave code is OK, but is quite limited, especially when it comes to animated visualisation. Also, I'd rather use a language that was open from the start (even if it has borrowed from Matlab in places) than one that sets out explicitly to be a matlab clone. My Java and C experience will come in handy with python, and I really think it will open up the possibilities.
